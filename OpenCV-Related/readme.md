Computer vison: Computer vision is  a field of study which enables computers to replicate the human visual system. It's a subset of artificial intelligence which collects information from digital images or videos and processed them to define the attributes. The entire process involves image acquiring, screening , analysing, identifying and extracting informaition. 

- Resizing: Change the size of an image without keeping the propertions 
- Scaling: Enlarge or shrink and image while keeping the proportions
- Croping: Select a specific area of an image

- Translation: Translation is movement of image without deformation alogn x or y axis. Every pixel in image is translaed by same oamout.
- Rotation: Is a transformational operation. It is a process of changing the angle of the object. Rotation can be clockwise or anticlockwise. For rotation, there is angle of rotation and rotation point.
- Fliping: Proces of fliping an image, where image turns over, either vertically or horizontally, so that theimage is now a mirror image.

- RGB image: RGB stands for Red Green Blue. Most often, an RGB color is stored in structure or unsigned integer with BLue occuping the least significant area(a byte in 32-bit and 24-bit formats), Green the second least and red the third least.
- BGR image: BGR is the same as RGB, except the order of areas is reversed.
